# Dice Game Showdown

## Description

Dice Game Showdown is a fun multiplayer dice game where players take turns rolling a die to accumulate points. The game continues until one of the players reaches the target score of 50. The game allows 2 to 4 players and is designed to encourage strategy and quick decision-making.

## How to Play

1. Enter the number of players (between 2 and 4).
2. Players take turns to roll a 6-sided die.
3. If you roll a 1, your turn is over, and you lose the points you earned during that turn.
4. You can keep rolling until you decide to stop, but if you roll a 1, you lose all points accumulated during your turn.
5. The game ends when a player reaches or exceeds the target score of 50.

The winner is the player with the highest score once a player hits the target score.
